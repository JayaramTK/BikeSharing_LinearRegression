## General Information
This project aims to analyze a bike-sharing dataset and build a predictive model to forecast the number of bikes rented.
The dataset includes various features such as temperature, humidity, season, weather, etc that might influence bike rental patterns.
By analyzing these features, we aim to understand the key factors affecting bike rentals and use this understanding to develop a predictive model.

## Technologies Used
Python - version 3.10
pandas - version 2.0.3
numpy - version 1.23.2
scikit-learn - version 1.1.2
matplotlib - version 3.6.2
seaborn - version 0.12.2


## Conclusions
Conclusion 1: Temperature and weather conditions significantly affect bike rentals. Warmer weather tends to increase the number of rentals.
Conclusion 2: The time of day (year) also play a crucial role in rental patterns with 2019 seeing more rentals than the year 2018.
Conclusion 3: The predictive model developed, which uses a regression approach, can effectively forecast bike rental numbers based on the given features.
Conclusion 4: Further improvements in model accuracy could be achieved by incorporating additional data or using more advanced machine learning techniques.
